Simple interface to create FITS binary tables.

This code was designed to be a very lightweight, header-only
library to generate simple FITS binary tables from C++.  So
far only a serial version exists, and only for some data types.
Extension to an MPI-parallel version and more data types will
follow if the need arises.
